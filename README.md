# Oblate WordPress Theme

### Custom Web Development Blog

I like simple, clean, minimalist blogs. I don't like sidebars, ads, widgets, plugins, or anything else on my blog - because if you're here, you're here for the content. 

Articles are organized into **Tutorials**, **Snippets**, and **Thoughts**. 

## External resources

* Syntax highlighting via [Prism](http://prismjs.com/)
* Task running via [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* Roboto font via [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)

## Directory Structure

* Theme files are all located in **wp-content/themes/oblate**
* Source files are located in `src` folder
* Running `gulp` command applies a Sass watch to source files and compiles to theme files
