# Oblate WordPress Theme

This is the code for [my website](https://www.taniarascia.com/), open source for your inspiration. It's not meant for installation or customization - a lot of Tania-specific data is hard-coded into it. I encourage you to be unique and create your own theme. If you don't know how to do so, [here is the tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/).

## External resources

* Syntax highlighting via [Prism](http://prismjs.com/)
* Task running via [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* Roboto font via [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)

## Directory Structure

* Theme files are all located in **wp-content/themes/oblate**
* Source files are located in `src` folder
* Running `gulp` command applies a Sass watch to source files and compiles to theme files
